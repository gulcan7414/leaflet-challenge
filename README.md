The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.
In this project,I have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations on issues facing our planet.
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.
I used the data All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days.

The part I use Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
 
 * Markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour.
 * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in colour.
 * Markers popups provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
 * There is legend on the right bottom that will provide context for map data.

For second 2 I add tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
